# ⚙️ 4. Task 1 — ML Pipeline & Data Validation

## ✅ Data Validation

* Checked missing values
* Removed duplicate entries
* Verified data types

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering

Four additional features were created:

* `Hour`
* `Log_Amount`
* `Amount_Z`
* `Amount_Rolling_Mean`

## 🤖 Model Selection

**Model Used:** Logistic Regression

### Reason for Selection:

* Easy to interpret
* Stable performance
* Suitable for imbalanced datasets

## 🔁 Cross Validation

* Stratified K-Fold (5 folds)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* ROC-AUC Score
* F1 Score
* Precision
* Recall

## 💾 Model Saving

* Model stored using `joblib`

## ♻️ Reproducibility

* Random seed fixed for consistent results

---

# 🐞 5. Task 2 — Debugging

## ❗ Problems Identified

* Low F1 score
* Severe class imbalance
* Unstable predictions

## 🔍 Root Causes

* Skewed data distribution
* Default probability threshold
* Random sampling effects

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

* SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
* Threshold tuning

## 📊 Results

**Before Optimization:**

* F1 Score ≈ 0.07

**After Optimization:**

* F1 Score ≈ 0.10

---

# 🚀 6. Task 3 — Performance Improvement

## 📌 Techniques Used

* SMOTE
* Advanced feature engineering
* Threshold optimization

## 📈 Improvement Achieved

* 40%+ increase in F1 Score

## 🎯 Reason for Improvement

* Better learning of minority class patterns
* Reduced bias toward majority class
